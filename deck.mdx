  3 of the most commonly talked about tools might be these three. Often, we sees them as competing with each other.

<Notes>
  This is taken from Evan You's talk in JSConf Asia 2019. Frameworks are actually making decisions and therefore, 
  tradeoffs in multiple dimensions.

<Notes>
  So, in some way, we can see that these frameworks/libraries are covering different spaces, and it allows us:
  the devs, to be able to pick one according to our needs. Together, the frameworks help us to 
  improve the web platform as a whole.

<Notes>
  This is taken from Nicole Sullivan talk in this year I/O. So obviously, Google has a role in helping to improve
  the web platform. One example is they work together with framework/libraries authors, and maybe ship a new API based on 
  the real needs that exist. In the talk, she mentioned about how they discussed about how Chrome can help frameworks by
  providing a better scheduler API in the browser.
  We, web developers also have a role in this. Based on how we use frameworks,
  our feedback to them, how we develop our own web app/sites, etc.

<Notes>
  Numbers from Nicole's talk as well. 97% of bundles are npm modules. That's a huge part of our app.
</Notes>

---

# Many developers don't know how 3rd party modules work internally at all

<Notes>
  I don't have numbers for this. It's just from my experience interviewing people.
  
  For example, when we asked about how to make a web design responsive, we were expecting media query answer, right?
  The guy answered: "Use bootstrap". Okay, but how does bootstrap do it? The answer was: "I don't know".

  The vast JS ecosystem has made it so much easier to build something. We can take modules from npm,
  and just plug it into our app. It's a great thing!
  But, we have grown so accustomed to it and start taking it for granted. I am not saying we need
  to know everything, how the module works in an exact way; but we need to have some level of 
  understanding about it, not just blindly using it.
  
  This phenomenon has produced a mindset like...

# Frameworks are magic ‚ú®
# The maintainers are wizards üé©

<Notes>
  As the result, we don't dive into their codes. Eventhough most of them are totally open to be read.
  It's hard to make our web better, if we don't know what's going on in our web!
  At times, it almost feel useless to dive into their code. We might think: "Can I understand it?"

<Image src={require("file-loader!./assets/dan-dont-know.png")} style={{ backgroundSize: 'contain', width: '85vw' }} />

<Notes>
  Framework maintainers are just people too, like you and me! I really like this tweet and post by
  Dan Abramov, admitting about what he didn't know. Eventhough people might expect that he already
  knows a lot of these stuffs, like terminal commands, TCP stack, etc.

# What is this talk about?

# What do you get out of this?

<Appear>
  <h3>Become more comfortable in the vast JS ecosystem üõã</h3>
  <h3>No longer view framework maintainers as wizards üé©</h3>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  And hopefully, with these, you can contribute more to the web platform.
  Either by creating your own libraries/frameworks, or just make better decisions when building your own app.

# One effective way to make something not mysterious is to just dive into it

  Tells story about my journey with wasm. I finally decided to dive into it and apparently, it wasn't so bad.

# We will be trying to find out how hooks in React works ‚öõÔ∏è Ô∏è

<Notes>
  So for example, we will try to understand how hooks in react work, by trying to implement it on our own.

<Image src={require("file-loader!./assets/vue-hooks.png")} style={{ backgroundSize: 'contain', width: '85vw' }} />

<Notes>
  I chose hooks because I personally think the design of hooks is interesting. Even Evan You, the creator of VueJS
  is currently experimenting with hooks in Vue.

# :no_entry_sign: :atom_symbol: This is __**NOT**__ React :no_entry_sign: :atom_symbol:

  A lot of edge cases aren't covered. But it is a useful mental model for us to understand what this library is doing.

## Magic, ~~begone~~ reduced ‚ú®

<Notes>
  Hopefully, that live coding helped you see that frameworks aren't magic. They are only mysterious
  because we haven't dived into them yet.
</Notes>

---

## Why do we use frameworks?

<Notes>
  You see, a simple hook implementation can be done in under 1 hour. So why do we use react? 
  More generally, why do we use frameworks? We might say it is to help us build web app.
</Notes>

---

## What do they do? 
## How do they do it?

<Notes>
  If you haven't done it yet, to start dig into these questions! It will help you become
  a better web developer. And with more better web developer around, the web platform would
  improve as well as the effect. We will have better community, better toolings, better frameworks.
  All for the betterment of the web platform that we know and love.
</Notes>

---

## Stop seeing frameworks as magic! ‚ú®

<Notes>
  If you didn't get anything from this talk so far, this is the one thing you at least should take away from it today!

  By stop viewing frameworks as magic, and digging into them, we can improve ourselves.
  By improving ourselves, we can improve the web platform as well. 
</Notes>

## Be part of what makes the web awesome! üòé

  Closing words, be part of what makes the web awesome! 
  Either by your awesome web app, our your awesome frameworks, we all have a role!
